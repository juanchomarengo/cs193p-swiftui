# Stanford CS193p - Developing Apps for iOS using SwiftUI

Welcome to my repository for the **[CS193p - Developing Apps for iOS](https://cs193p.stanford.edu)** course offered by Stanford University. This repository contains my work and projects as I follow along with the course lectures, assignments, and exercises.

## Course Overview

**CS193p** focuses on building applications for iOS using **SwiftUI**, Apple's declarative framework for user interface development. The course covers a range of topics, including the Swift programming language, the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, animations, and more advanced concepts like multithreading and document-based applications.

The lectures for Spring 2023 were conducted in person but were not video recorded. However, screen captures of the presentations and demos, along with the associated audio, are available. This course builds on the previous iterations of CS193p, with updates reflecting the latest in iOS development, such as the changes introduced with SwiftUI in WWDC 2023.

## Repository Structure

- **Lecture Notes:** Detailed notes from each lecture, summarizing key concepts and code snippets.
- **Assignments:** Solutions and code for the programming assignments given throughout the course.
- **Projects:** Larger projects developed during the course, including the **Memorize** and **Emoji Art** applications.
- **Reading Material:** Summaries and reflections on the recommended reading materials.
